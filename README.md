# Trade Winds

Project built while doing the Udemy course [Master Godot UI: Interfaces with Control Nodes (2024)](https://www.udemy.com/share/10cSRP3@zk9E2x9L2bjsJr2KL0CzcSV3AAFI2fdQJd8Wg59dS3trVNFp8UL1c9T2937jDsLn/)

Note not all elements of final project are in place as actual course does not provide all assets, e.g. map for last lesson, many icons, etc.

As I was interested in honing my skills using Godot UI nodes not doing the authors work for them I did not fill in these portions.
